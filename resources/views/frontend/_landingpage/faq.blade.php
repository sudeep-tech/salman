                              afnaideal.com sends an e-mail that contains the User ID and Password to the email address that you have provided while registering/signing up. If you have by mistake provided a wrong email address (usually a spelling mistake) then it bounces back to us. In that case we will try to contact you via your telephone number, provided you entered a phone number in the sign-up page while registering. If the email address is not your own the mail goes to that person and you must get the information from them. In that case, you can send a request email to info@afnaideal.com that would include your User ID, Full Name, your correct email address (it is advised to send the mail from the email address that you would provide), and Telephone No, date of sign up. We will verify the information, make the necessary changes and inform you.

                                Yes! We can help you post your resume for you. But we strongly suggest that members post their resumes themselves. If you are a user that does not have Internet access or very limited access to the Internet then we can help you; but before that you would have to register at afnaideal.com yourself. Once you have registered, send us your resume/CV in readable Word Format or text format with your User ID, email address (that you have used while registering) via e-mail (at info@afnaideal.com ) or mail us at G.P.O. Box 8975 E.P.C. 1011, Kathmandu, Nepal.
